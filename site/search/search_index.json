Documentation : https://connectapi.io Source Code : https://github.com/connectapi/connectapi ConnectAPI is a system built to help backend developers to write less and get more. ConnectAPI allows you to run multiple APIs with no code at all, and manage them with nice and easy dashboard. The main goal of ConnectAPI is to improve developer experience by helping you use open source services with auto generated SDKs and documentation for multiple languages and frameworks. ConnectAPI also make it easy for other developers to use your service by providing a service marketplace , it also possible to make money on the marketplace by requiring a payment on your service. \ud83d\udea8 Warning \u00b6 This system is work in progress, it is not advisable to use it in production yet!. Can I Use It? \u00b6 Yes \ud83c\udf89 (but continue reading). You can use this and evaluate the idea and ease of use I'm proposing. It will probably be useful to know if it works and is useful for you (I hope so). But still, consider this lab material, expect it to change a bit. \ud83e\uddea If you do use it and want to write me your thoughts please contact me on yehotada.sht@gmail.com Requirements \u00b6 As ConnectAPI is running on Docker it will require you to install it on your machine. Installation \u00b6 docker run -it --rm \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ -v /opt:/var/lib:rw \\ -e MARKETPLACE_URL = 'https://market.boxs.ml' \\ --network host \\ connectapihub/connectapi install How to Use \u00b6 Like you see on the last line of the output the system is running a dashboard on port 6489 by default, Registering to the Dashboard as quick as possible is important, the Dashboard will make the first user to register a root user on the system. After registering you can start searching on the Marketplace for services, once found you can view their docs, endpoints and examples. the installation is simple just click on the installation button. After the installation the service will be added to your system tab and display monitoring info, and will allow you to config it to your needs. Developer Experience \u00b6 Everything in ConnectAPI is designed to get the best developer experience possible. Every service that upload to the Marketplace has to have OpenAPI spec file, on upload the Marketplace generate SDKs and documentations for the supported languages, and upload the SDKs to their package managers, so you can just install them and use the service without dealing with http requests. Example code to show you how your code will look using our ConnectAPI from connectapi_core import Client # core sdk for python from connectapi_demo import Demo # Auto generated sdk for the demo service Client . set_url ( \"http://your.server.domain\" ) Client . set_token ( token = \"<TOKEN FROM THE DASHBOARD>\" , ) demo_service = Demo ( client = Client ()) r = demo_service . multiply_two_numbers ( a = 16 , b = 8 ) print ( r ) r = demo_service . sum_two_numbers ( a = 16 , b = 8 ) print ( r ) r = demo_service . random_int_from_range ( a =- 50 , b = 50 ) print ( r ) r = demo_service . random_string ( n = 10 ) print ( r ) License \u00b6 TODO: add licence","title":"ConnectAPI"},{"location":"#warning","text":"This system is work in progress, it is not advisable to use it in production yet!.","title":"\ud83d\udea8 Warning"},{"location":"#can-i-use-it","text":"Yes \ud83c\udf89 (but continue reading).
