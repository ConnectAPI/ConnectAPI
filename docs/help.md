There are very simple ways to help (several involve just one or two clicks).

And there are several ways to get help too.

## Try It

The main thing you can do is try **ConnectAPI** out and see if this system is **helpful** for you.

Knowing if it's useful or if you find any obvious problem with its design would be helpful.

## Star **ConnectAPI** in GitHub

By adding a star, other users will be able to find it more easily and see that it has been already useful for others.
